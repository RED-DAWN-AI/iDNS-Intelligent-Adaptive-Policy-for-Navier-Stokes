## Core Technologies

### ⚡ RASI™ — Regularity-Adaptive Spectral Integration
**"Night vision for turbulence"**

Temporal lifting controller that navigates computational singularities via diffeomorphic time reparameterization.

```
∂τU = (1/φ′) × N(U)

where φ′ = Φ(‖Ω‖_∞) ∈ [φ_min, φ_max]
```

- Concentrates sampling where solution curve bends hardest
- 33× temporal oversampling in stiff regions
- Decouples numerical stability from spatial resolution
- **Status: Production (v7.4+)**

---

### 🧹 The Spectral Janitor™ — Cascade-Completion Clamping
**"Doing what physics would do with more modes"**

Post-integration energy hygiene that enforces theoretical spectral envelopes at the truncation boundary.

```
E_clamped = min(E_measured, E_theoretical)

where E_theoretical = E_ref × (k/k_ref)^(-3)
```

- Drains pile-up energy that would dissipate at k_d
- Prevents backscatter contamination to low-k modes
- Does NOT modify Navier-Stokes equations
- **Status: Production (v8+)**

---

### 🎯 BKM Sentinel™ — Regularity Monitor  
**"Watching the vorticity so you don't have to"**

Real-time monitoring of the Beale-Kato-Majda integral for singularity detection.

```
BKM(t) = ∫₀ᵗ ‖ω(s)‖_∞ ds

Singularity ⟺ BKM → ∞
```

- Continuous integration of vorticity maximum
- Early warning system for regularity threats
- Provides Clay Prize-relevant diagnostics
- **Status: Production (v7+)**

Planned extension for surgical correction of specific spectral anomalies without global filtering.

- Identify and correct individual rogue modes
- Preserve neighboring mode integrity  
- Sub-shell precision energy management
- **Status: Conceptual**

---

### 🔮 Cascade Oracle™ — Predictive Spectral Modeling
**"Knowing where the energy wants to go"**

ML-assisted prediction of cascade dynamics for proactive management.

- Neural network trained on resolved DNS
- Predicts pile-up before it accumulates
- Adaptive CCC threshold optimization
- **Status: Future Research**

---

### ⏱️ Temporal Telescope™ — Multi-Scale Time Integration
**"Zoom in on the action, fast-forward the boring parts"**

Hierarchical temporal lifting for extreme scale separation.

- Nested φ′ controllers for different timescales
- Sub-cycling for localized stiff events
- Seamless scale transitions
- **Status: Future Research**

---

### 🌊 Domain Liberator™ — Non-Periodic Extensions
**"Breaking free from the torus"**

Extension of spectral-temporal methods beyond T³.

- Chebyshev-based lifting for bounded domains
- Immersed boundary compatibility
- Real-world geometry support
- **Status: Long-Term Research**

## Design Philosophy

> **"We don't modify Navier-Stokes. We just help it be its best self."**

All iDNS technologies share a common principle: the governing equations remain untouched. We use:

- **Coordinate transformations** (temporal lifting)
- **Post-processing corrections** (spectral clamping)
- **Diagnostic monitoring** (BKM tracking)

Never:
- Artificial viscosity
- Hyperviscosity terms
- Subgrid models
- Equation modifications

## Branding Note

Yes, we actually trademarked "The Spectral Janitor™" for a computational fluid dynamics technology.

Yes, we put emoji in our technical documentation.

No, we will not apologize.

The math is rigorous. The vibes are immaculate. 💜
